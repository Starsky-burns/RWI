      We‚Äôll host you a night of Dungeons and Dragons at a local pub, your office, or another venue of your choice (castle? yes please) - a bar tab and snacks are included so all you pay is a flat fee.
      <br>
      <br>
      We‚Äôll bring everything to give you the real deal: maps, props, miniatures, dice, handouts, and character sheets.
      <br>
      <br>
      This is your chance to find out what the fuss is about; all you have to do is turn up, sit down, and have fun.

      A tabletop renaissance
    </h1>

    <p class="renaissancetext">
      Dungeons and Dragons is more popular now than ever before, but people wanting to play outnumber Game Masters tenfold at least.
      <br>
      <br>
      A single Game Master leads the session, guiding the other players through an adventure.  The players take the role of adventurers, facing whatever obstacles the story throws at them.
      <br>
      <br>
      Our Game Masters take on the roles of performers, writers, historians, linguists, game designers, musicians and more, ready to adapt to your adventure.

      How it goes
    </h1>

    <p class="goestext">
      We‚Äôve got a roster of adventures and adventurers - we‚Äôll have a chat about the vibe your group is looking for before the session and whip up something you‚Äôll be excited about.
      <br>
      <br>
      We‚Äôll teach you how to play as we go along so you don‚Äôt need to have experience; it‚Äôs super easy.
      <br>
      <br>
      Typically, sessions last around 4 hours. It will be a self-contained story, with room to keep going on another day if you find yourself wanting to come back for more.
      <br>
      <br>
      We‚Äôre easy-going and inclusive so your group will feel right at home.

      <p class="review_text">I'd highly recommend Eryk and Sam as hosts for Dungeons and Dragons. If you have played before or if you are new to the game they are both very easy to get on with and make you feel very welcome. If you have never played before and fancy something different, give this a go.
        <br>
        <br>
        Thanks very much for a great evening.

      <p class="right_grid review_text">I haven't laughed as much as I did tonight in a while. It wasn't my first board game but surely my first D&D experience. Eryk was beyond patient (and tolerated a dozen silly jokes an hour). Highly recommended for those who want a friendly environment and a smooth first game.
      <br>
      <br>
      The game and company were both lovely.

      <p class="review_text">I played D&D 40 years ago, my g/f has never played, but wanted to see what it was all about. Despite the huge gap in experience we both had a great time. We will definitely be back!
        <br>
        <br>
        If you've never played before, but have an imagination... give it a go, you won't regret it.

      <p class="right_grid review_text">We had such a great night... The session was well ran in a way that brought the 4 of us along despite our different levels of experience and knowledge. He was patient and good natured with our kids (8 and 12) who were at times a challenge to keep on topic.
        <br>
        <br>
        Would highly recommend as an introduction to the world of dungeons and dragons... or experienced role players looking for a different night out.
